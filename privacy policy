Camera Permission

Why We Need Camera Access

DoodleDates requests permission to access your device's camera solely to enable you to take profile photos. Camera access is completely optional.

How Camera Access Works

Permission Required: You must explicitly grant camera permission before we can access your camera
User Control: You can deny or revoke camera permission at any time through your device settings
Limited Use: Camera is only activated when you choose "Take Photo" when updating your profile picture
No Background Access: We never access your camera in the background or without your explicit action
Alternative Option: You can always choose photos from your device's library instead of taking a new photo
What Happens to Photos

Profile photos you capture are uploaded to our secure servers
Photos are stored securely and used only to display your profile to potential matches
You can delete or change your profile photo at any time
We do not share your photos with third parties for advertising or marketing purposes
We do not use facial recognition or analyze photos beyond displaying them in your profile
If You Deny Camera Permission

If you choose not to grant camera access, you can still:

Use all app features normally
Upload profile photos from your device's photo library
Change your profile photo using existing photos
Photo & Media Library Access

DoodleDates may request permission to access your photo library to allow you to select existing photos as your profile picture. Photos selected from your library are:

Only accessed when you explicitly choose to add/change your profile photo
Uploaded to our servers and displayed on your profile
Never accessed without your direct action
Not shared with third parties for marketing purposes
